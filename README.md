Digital Business Cards to implement light and dark mode functionality

Switching between light and dark mode is one of the most common features in every web or mobile application. I realized I hadn't implemented this in any of my projects so Naturally, I challenged myself to learn by building a simple digital business card that switches between light and dark mode.

P.S If anyone knows how to resize the Linkedin logo on the business card I am all ears 😅 🤝
